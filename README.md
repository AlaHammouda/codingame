## What is codingame?

[**Codingame**](https://www.codingame.com/training) is an online platform offering ressources for developpers to developp their coding skills.

It includes

* [**puzzles**](https://www.codingame.com/training) **_ordered_** by difficulty and **_labelled_** with the concept you may need to solve them.

* [**bot fights**](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming) - **_Compete_** in multiplayers programming contests involving artificial intelligence !

* [**Clash of codes**](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode) - **_Challenge_** yourself and be the first to complete a puzzle in 15-minutes !


This folder is dedicated to **some of my solutions** for the puzzles.
